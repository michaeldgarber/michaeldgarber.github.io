While I was at Emory, I served as a teaching assistant for several courses on epidemiologic methods with a focus on theory and methods for causal inference. In my role as a CDC contractor, I co-led a series of workshops on using R for GIS. Please find links below to some of these teaching materials.

## Epidemiologic methods
I created RMarkdown documents for some of my teaching-assistant sessions. Here are a few.

## R for GIS
Lots of great teaching material covering R and R for GIS exists on the internet (e.g., https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/, https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/, and much more). Our goal was to bring this material to the attention of our CDC colleagues and highlight tools we have found particularly useful for the management, analysis, and visualization of public-health-relevant data.
