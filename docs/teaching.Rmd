While I was at Emory, I served as a teaching assistant for several courses on epidemiologic methods with a focus on theory and methods for causal inference. In my role as a CDC contractor, I co-led a series of workshops on using R for GIS. Please find links below to some of these teaching materials.

## Epidemiologic methods
I created RMarkdown documents for some of my teaching-assistant sessions. Here are a few.

## R for GIS
A wealth of excellent teaching material covering R and R for GIS exists on the internet (e.g., https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/, https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/, and many more.) Our goal with these sessions was not to re-create this material but rather to bring these resources to the attention of our colleagues at CDC and demonstrate tools we have used for the management, analysis, and visualization of spatial data relevant for public health.
