#### Sampling, selection bias, and aggregated mobile-phone data

My mentors, colleagues, and I have aimed to better understand how epidemiologic principles including selection bias and study designs can inform the valid use of "big data" sources generated from mobile devices in research. Illustrative papers are listed below. I am most of proud of [this paper](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Fulltext/2021/01000/At_risk_measure_Sampling_in_Case_Control_Studies.14.aspx), in which we extend case-control sampling to show how aggregated smartphone-generated data can be used to estimate the incidence rate ratio in epidemiologic studies.

#### Causal-inference concepts
Informed by my teaching experience, I have written about how the potential-outcome model from epidemiology can be a useful frame for electoral questions and have commented on the utility of causal-inference tools for environmental epidemiology:

#### Physical fitness in children
Finally, my colleagues and I have conducted research on physical fitness in youth and its social and geographical determinants:
