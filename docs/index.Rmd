As an epidemiologist, I study how places can be designed and managed to support population health and climate resilience. I have a particular interest in policies that may reduce the inequitable population-health consequences of car-dependent environments and support the [safety](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10773466/) and [appeal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9211442/) of active transportation.

I have methodological expertise in policy evaluation, health-impact assessment, geospatial analysis, and the design of case-control studies.

I earned my MPH and PhD in Epidemiology from Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and I am currently a post-doctoral researcher with UC San Diego. I have authored 25 peer-reviewed journal articles, including 13 as lead author. In 2022, I received the [Rothman Epidemiology Prize](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2022/07000/michael_d__garber,_winner_of_the_2022_rothman.1.aspx) for our [article](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2021/01000/at_risk_measure_sampling_in_case_control_studies.14.aspx) published in *Epidemiology*.

In recent work, my colleagues and I wrote about pathways linking parking with public health and how epidemiology can inform urban-health understanding and action:
