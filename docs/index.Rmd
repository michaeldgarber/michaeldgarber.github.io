I am an epidemiologist interested in the effects of urban design and related policies on health, health equity, and climate-change mitigation and resilience. I am especially interested in policies that reduce car dependency and improve the [safety](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214140523001056) and [appeal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9211442/) of active transportation.

My methodological interests include [causal-inference](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Fulltext/2019/05000/Is_the_Smog_Lifting___Causal_Inference_in.2.aspx) methods (including group-level [approaches](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2024/03000/precision_and_weighting_of_effects_estimated_by.17.aspx) for policy evaluation), [principles](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214140518305590) [for](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1047279722000370) valid use of aggregated mobile-device-generated data in epidemiology, and [case-control studies](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Fulltext/2021/01000/At_risk_measure_Sampling_in_Case_Control_Studies.14.aspx).

I am currently a post-doctoral researcher with UC San Diego. I earned my MPH and PhD in Epidemiology from Emory University Rollins School of Public Health. In 2022, I received the [Rothman Epidemiology Prize](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2022/07000/michael_d__garber,_winner_of_the_2022_rothman.1.aspx), an award given annually for the best article published in *Epidemiology* in the preceding year.
