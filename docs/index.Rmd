A social and environmental epidemiologist by training, I study how urban design and related policies affect population health and climate resilience. I am especially interested in policies that reduce car dependency and improve the [safety](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10773466/) and [appeal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9211442/) of active transportation.

I earned my MPH and PhD in Epidemiology from Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and I am currently a post-doctoral researcher with UC San Diego. I have authored 25 peer-reviewed articles, including 13 as lead author. In 2022, I received the [Rothman Epidemiology Prize](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2022/07000/michael_d__garber,_winner_of_the_2022_rothman.1.aspx) for our article published in *Epidemiology*.
