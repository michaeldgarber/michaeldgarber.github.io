Hi, thanks for visiting my website.

I am an epidemiologist interested in the effects of urban design and policies on health, health equity, and climate-change resilience. I conduct research with the ultimate aim of making places safer and more welcoming for walking, biking, using a wheelchair, and other forms of active transportation.

My methodological interests include causal-inference methods (including quasi-experimental [approaches](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Citation/2022/07000/Have_Paved_Trails_and_Protected_Bike_Lanes_Led_to.7.aspx) for policy evaluation) and [case-control studies](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Fulltext/2021/01000/At_risk_measure_Sampling_in_Case_Control_Studies.14.aspx).

I am currently a post-doctoral researcher with joint affiliations at UC San Diego and Colorado State University. I earned my PhD in Epidemiology from Emory University Rollins School of Public Health in 2020.
