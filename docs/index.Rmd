Hi, welcome to my website.

I am a post-doctoral fellow in epidemiology at Colorado State University. I conduct research with the long-term aim of making places safer and more welcoming for biking, walking, and other non-polluting active forms of transportation and recreation. I have contributed to epidemiologic methods by illustrating how aggregated data generated from smartphones can be used in a case-control-study framework ([2021](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Fulltext/2021/01000/At_risk_measure_Sampling_in_Case_Control_Studies.14.aspx)), with applications for transportation safety. As a PhD student in Emory's Epidemiology program, I was a teaching assistant for a course covering methods for causal inference with observational data and have applied these methods to built-environment research ([2022](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Abstract/9900/Have_paved_trails_and_protected_bike_lanes_led_to.15.aspx)).
