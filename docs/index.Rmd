As a social and environmental epidemiologist, I study how places can be designed and managed to support population health and climate resilience. I have led research

-   investigating how bike infrastructure, like paved paths and protected bike lanes, affects [bicycling](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9211442/) and bicycling [safety](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10773466/);

-   estimating health impacts of urban green space [locally](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412023003239) and [globally](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01803-y); and

-   describing how [parking](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40572-024-00465-4) policy may affect population health and health equity.

I have methodological expertise in

-   policy evaluation and quasi-experimental [methods](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2024/03000/precision_and_weighting_of_effects_estimated_by.17.aspx),

-   health-impact assessment,

-   the valid use of smartphone-generated active-transportation [data](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6959852/) in research,

-   the design of [case-control studies](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7707160/), and

-   spatial data science using R.

I earned my MPH and PhD in Epidemiology from Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and I am currently a post-doctoral researcher with UC San Diego. I have authored 25 peer-reviewed journal articles, including 13 as lead author.

In 2022, I received the [Rothman Epidemiology Prize](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2022/07000/michael_d__garber,_winner_of_the_2022_rothman.1.aspx) for our [article](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2021/01000/at_risk_measure_sampling_in_case_control_studies.14.aspx) published in *Epidemiology*.
