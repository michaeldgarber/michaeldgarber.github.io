As a social and environmental epidemiologist, I study how transportation systems, urban design, and land-use policy shape population health and climate resilience. I have led research examining:

-   how bike infrastructure, including paved paths and protected bike lanes, affects bicycling levels and safety;

-   how urban design can support active transportation resilience during extreme heat; and

-   how parking policy and car-dependent land use shape population health and health equity.

My methodological expertise includes:

-   policy evaluation and quasi-experimental causal-inference methods,

-   health-impact assessment,

-   the valid use of smartphone- and GPS-generated active-transportation data in population-health research,

-   case-control and other epidemiologic study designs, and

-   spatial data science and visualization using R.

I earned my MPH and PhD in Epidemiology from Emory University Rollins School of Public Health. I have authored 25+ peer-reviewed journal articles, including 15 as first author. In 2022, I received the Rothman Epidemiology Prize for our article published in *Epidemiology*.
